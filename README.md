# Python
This repository contains projects in Python that were created along my journey as a Pythonaut. 
The projects are work done in order to practice python skills starting from a beginner level. 
At the intermediate level I learnt about APIs, retrieving data from online sources and data manipulation. Additionally, learnt how to use Python and Flask to work
on the back end of a web application, in combination of my front end skills in HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.
Currently at advanced level, practicing data manipulation and analysis using popular libraries such as Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib with the objective to work on fully fledged projects.
